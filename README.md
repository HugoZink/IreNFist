# IREnFIST
A comprehensive rebalance mod for PAYDAY 2, which rebalances weapons, enemies, and even assault squads. This is a fork of the original IreNFist mod by Solo Queue Pixy, which was discontinued.
This fork was updated to include the newest DLC weapons and weapon mods, and full VR compatibility has been added. Assaults were also tweaked (re-added shotgunners and hostage rescue teams).

For VR users, the [VR Recoil mod](https://github.com/HugoZink/PD2VRRecoil) is strongly recommended. Recoil is a big part of weapon balance in IreNFist.

# Installation
[Grab the latest release from the Releases Page.](https://github.com/HugoZink/IreNFist/releases/tag/refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster) Extract the contents of `irenfist.zip` to your mods folder.
SuperBLT and BeardLib are both required.

# Custom Weapons
This mod supports many different BeardLib Custom Weapons. [A full list can be found on the MWS page.](https://modworkshop.net/mod/28585)

If you want to see support for a custom weapon added, the fastest and best way to do so is to make a Fork of this repository, then make your changes to the fork and open a Pull Request.
You can also suggest it be added on the Issues page or on the MWS page, but I'm not likely to take suggestions if the weapon isn't sufficiently interesting.

# Beta Features
This mod has beta features that can be enabled in the options. The current beta features are:
* **New Assaults:** The entire police force has been given a makeover in the classic style. Enemies will now greatly resemble that of pre-Hoxton Housewarming, both in variety, damage output and numbers.
